# gammenion.github.io source files
This is the folder holding source files for the Hugo static HTML creator.  
It uses theme [hugo-theme-bleak](https://github.com/Zenithar/hugo-theme-bleak) with customized style.css and header.html.  
There are two config files, one for each available language:
* `config_bleak.toml`: for the English site, contents at `/content/`
* `config_bleak_br.toml`: for the Portuguese site, contents at `/content.br/`
The content is the same but in different languages.
